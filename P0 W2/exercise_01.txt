// 1. Newton Second Law -------------------------------

    // -Algorithm-

    1. ΣF = m.a
    2. ΣF = "resultant force"
    3. m = "mass"
    4. a = "acceleration"
    5. Count ΣF for mass of 600 (kg) when acceleration equals to 2 (m/s2).

    // -Pseudocode-

    STORE "mass" with any value
    STORE "acceleration" with any value
    STORE "resultant force" without any value

    CALCULATE "mass" TIMES "acceleration"
    SET "resultant force" value with calculation result

    DISPLAY "resultant force"


    CALCULATION

    STORE "mass" with 600
    STORE "acceleration" with 2

    CALCULATE 600 TIMES 2
    SET "resultant force" value with 1200

    DISPLAY 1200


// 2. Leap Year ---------------------------------------

> coba dibranch sesuai pseudocode

    // -Algorithm-

    Calculate whether a year is a leap year utilising the following algorithm:

	1. If the "year" modulo 4 equals to 0 AND the "year" modulo 100 equals to 0 AND the "year" modulo 400 equals to 0, it is a "leap year"
    2. Else if the "year" modulo 4 equals to 0 AND the "year" modulo 100 not equal to 0, it is a "leap year" 	
    3. Else it is not a leap year

    // -Pseudocode-

    STORE "year" with any number

    CALCULATE "year" MOD 4 
    STORE "remainder-1" to the result of calculation

    CALCULATE "year" MOD 100 
    STORE "remainder-2" to the result of calculation

    CALCULATE "year" MOD 400 
    STORE "remainder-3" to the result of calculation
    
    IF "remainder-1", "remainder-2", and "remainder-3" EQUAL to 0
        DISPLAY "It is a leap year"

    ELSE IF

        "remainder-1" EQUALS to 0 AND "remainder-2" NOT EQUAL to 0
        DISPLAY "It is a leap year"

    ELSE

        DISPLAY "It is not a leap year"


// 3. Laundry Day -------------------------------------

    // -Algorithm-

    1. Add clothes to the washing machine
    2. When there are 20 clothes inside turn on the washing machine

    // -Pseudocode-

    STORE "clothes" with 0

    WHILE "clothes" < 20
        ADD "clothes" by 1

    TURN ON "washing machine"


// 4. Nail check --------------------------------------

    // -Algorithm-

    1. Check nails of 40 students
    2. When their nails are long give them punishment
    3. When their nails are short give them praise

    // -Pseudocode-

    STORE "student" with 1

    WHILE "student" < 41
        CHECK IF "long nails" EQUAL to TRUE
        IF TRUE 
            SHOW "punishment"

        ELSE

            SHOW "praise"

        ADD "student" by 1
