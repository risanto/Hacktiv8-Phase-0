1. Newton Second Law -------------------------------

  -Algorithm-

  1. Start by storing the resultant force as equal to mass times acceleration.
  2. Calculate the resultant force when the mass is 600 (kg) and the acceleration is 2 (m/s2).


  -Pseudocode-

  STORE "mass" with any value
  STORE "acceleration" with any value
  STORE "resultant force" without any value

  CALCULATE "mass" TIMES "acceleration"
  SET "resultant force" value with calculation result

  DISPLAY "resultant force"

  >CALCULATION

  STORE "mass" with 600
  STORE "acceleration" with 2

  CALCULATE 600 TIMES 2
  SET "resultant force" value with 1200

  DISPLAY 1200


2. Leap Year ---------------------------------------

  -Algorithm-

  1. Start by storing the year with any number value.
  2. Find the remainders through modulo operation which divides the year with 4, 100, and 400.
  3. Set the following conditions.
    a. If the year modulo 4, year modulo 100, and year modulo 100 has the remainder of 0; then the year is a leap year.
    b. If the year modulo 4 is 0 but year modulo 100 is not 0; then the year is a leap year.
    c. Else, it is not a leap year.
  4. Display the result.


  -Pseudocode-

  STORE "year" with any number

  CALCULATE "year" MOD 4 
  STORE "remainder-1" to the result of calculation

  CALCULATE "year" MOD 100 
  STORE "remainder-2" to the result of calculation

  CALCULATE "year" MOD 400 
  STORE "remainder-3" to the result of calculation
  
  IF "remainder-1", "remainder-2", and "remainder-3" EQUAL to 0
      DISPLAY "It is a leap year"

  ELSE IF

      "remainder-1" EQUALS to 0 AND "remainder-2" NOT EQUAL to 0
      DISPLAY "It is a leap year"

  ELSE

      DISPLAY "It is not a leap year"


3. Laundry Day -------------------------------------

    -Algorithm-

    1. Start by adding clothes to the washing machine until there are 20 clothes inside.
    2. When the condition is fulfilled, turn on the washing machine.

    -Pseudocode-

    STORE "clothes" with 0

    WHILE "clothes" < 20
        ADD "clothes" by 1

    TURN ON "washing machine"


4. Nail check --------------------------------------

    -Algorithm-

    1. Start to check nails of each student in the class.
    2. When checking, set the following conditions:
      a. Long nails will be punished.
      b. Short nails will be praised.  
    3. Repeat until all 40 of the students nails are checked.

    -Pseudocode-

    STORE "student" with 1
    SET variable "longNails"

    WHILE "student" < 41
        CHECK IF "longNails" EQUAL to TRUE
        IF TRUE 
            SHOW "punishment"

        ELSE

            SHOW "praise"

        ADD "student" by 1
